          <h3>Family First</h3>
          <p>My family is a huge part of my life. Between my son's sports and my own athletic events, our schedule stays packed. I'm grateful to have an active family and a home filled with things we've built ourselves.</p>

        <h3>PNW Roots</h3>
        <p>You'll often find us on the slopes, hiking trails, or doing all the typical PNW activities. I grew up in a small town called Hoquiam—meaning "Hungry for Wood"—with parents who were always working on houses, cars, or whatever project my dad could find to flip.</p>
        <div class="card-highlight">Their hustle taught me the value of hard work.</div>

        <h3>Competitive Spirit</h3>
        <p>Playing sports year-round and into college shaped me into both a team player and a leader. If you're around me long enough, you'll probably end up running with me, pushing past your limits, or trying something that challenges you.</p>
        <div class="card-highlight">My competitive nature and background drive me to constantly strive for more in everything I do.</div>

    <div class="values-grid">
      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">🤝</div>
        <h3>Leadership+Teamwork</h3>
        <p>I'm a big believer that leaders lead - no matter what. I started playing team sports when I was 4yr old and I can't remember a time I wasn't on a team. Teamwork is the entry fee for being a leader and I believe I was built to lead. It's something I gravitate towards and flex leading from the back and allowing others to lead the way and from the front where I break ground and show what can be done.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">💎</div>
        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>Integrity is table stakes in life. As my career has progressed and life has become heavier with responsibility, I've found being and showing high integrity keeps me grounded. Some know it as karma, but I believe what you put out into the world is what you get back.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">⚙️</div>
        <h3>Curiosity+Humility</h3>
        <p>I think of curiosity and humility as the same coin with different sides. They're part of my core values because curiosity is a core fundamental of learning and humility is a fundamental of openness. I'm innately curious and I've developed the emotional intelligence to have humility to new experiences, learnings, and what life throws at me.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">🏔️</div>
        <h3>Continuous Growth</h3>
        <p>Continuous learning is something that drives a lot of my purpose. It's enabled me to excel in tech and in school. Along with family, learning new things is what I believe what makes my life so rich. I have lofty goals of becoming a professor and learning all I can in this lifetime.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">🏋️‍♀️</div>
        <h3>Hard Work</h3>
        <p>I'm highly competitive. I played team and individual sports my entire life, coached high school wrestling for years, and my family has a large collection of boardgames we compete with eachother in. I love logic games, chess, and games that have social elements of negotiation. I'm always pushing myself and those around me to set big goals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="value-card">
        <div class="value-icon">🔧</div>
        <h3>Maker</h3>
        <p>If you're not making you're consuming. This value is something my family shares. I grew up in a family of DIYers and with the introduction of AI it's now easier than ever to create. I love to 3d print, write, and work on my house as well as in the digit world.</p>
