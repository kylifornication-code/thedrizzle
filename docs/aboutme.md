# Behind the Scenes: Life

My family is a big part of my life. My son's sports and my own athletic events manage to take up most of our schedule. I've been blessed to have an active family and a house full of stuff that we've built ourselves. From the dining room table, to custom library shelves, my wife and I are constantly working on projects and a chance to work with our hands. 

You'll catch our family on the slopes, doing hikes, and all of the other normal PNW things. I grew up in a small town called, Hoquiam, (meaning "Hungry for Wood"), with parents that worked on houses, cars, and anything my dad could think of flipping. My parents hustled a lot and it helped me understand the value of hardwork. 

Playing sports year around and into college nutured me into a team player and team leader. If you're around me long enough you'll probably end up running with me, going further than you have before or doing something that pushes you. My background and big competitive nature makes me strive for more in most situations. 

> The late great Bo Schembechler's "The Team" speech still rings in my ears when I think about how some of the best coaches built their teams.

# Behind the Scenes: Work

In my current role, I help lead the Enterprise Product Security team at Disney. We work with engineering teams across Disney, security testing anything we can get our hands on. 

I started out doing customer service jobs and working in restaurants. If you ever eat with my wife and I, you'll hear us over analyzing the flow, experience, and how the staff turn tables. 

Professionally, I specialize in leading and consulting engineering teams on DevSecOps and building products for engineers. While I started my career coding and working as a developer, I found my passion for being a team leader working between working hands on with engineers and building business cases and roadmaps. If you ask anyone I work with, they'll tell you that I'm extremely hard working, bring a lot of energy to work everyday, and thrive when I'm leading meetings.
