## Behind the Scenes: Life

My family is a huge part of my life. Between my son's sports and my own athletic events, our schedule stays packed. I’m grateful to have an active family and a home filled with things we’ve built ourselves. From the dining room table to custom library shelves, my wife and I are always working on new projects and taking every opportunity to create with our hands.

You'll often find us on the slopes, hiking trails, or doing all the typical PNW activities. I grew up in a small town called Hoquiam—meaning "Hungry for Wood"—with parents who were always working on houses, cars, or whatever project my dad could find to flip. Their hustle taught me the value of hard work.

Playing sports year-round and into college shaped me into both a team player and a leader. If you're around me long enough, you'll probably end up running with me, pushing past your limits, or trying something that challenges you. My competitive nature and background drive me to constantly strive for more in everything I do.

> The late great Bo Schembechler's "The Team" speech still rings in my ears when I think about how some of the best coaches built their teams.

## Behind the Scenes: Work

In my current role, I help lead the Enterprise Product Security team at Disney, working with engineering teams across the company to security test anything we can get our hands on.

I started my career in customer service and restaurants, which gave me an eye for operations. If you ever dine with my wife and me, you’ll probably hear us analyzing the flow, experience, and how the staff turn tables.

Professionally, I specialize in leading and consulting engineering teams on DevSecOps and building products for engineers. While I started out coding and working as a developer, I discovered my passion for leadership—bridging the gap between hands-on engineering work and high-level business strategy. I thrive in environments where I can build business cases, develop roadmaps, and lead teams to success. If you ask anyone I work with, they’ll tell you I’m extremely hard-working, bring energy to every day, and excel at leading projects.
