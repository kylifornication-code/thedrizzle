          <h3>Family First</h3>
          <p>My family is a huge part of my life. Between my son's sports and my own athletic events, our schedule stays packed. I'm grateful to have an active family and a home filled with things we've built ourselves.</p>

        <h3>PNW Roots</h3>
        <p>You'll often find us on the slopes, hiking trails, or doing all the typical PNW activities. I grew up in a small town called Hoquiam—meaning "Hungry for Wood"—with parents who were always working on houses, cars, or whatever project my dad could find to flip.</p>
        <div class="card-highlight">Their hustle taught me the value of hard work.</div>

        <h3>Competitive Spirit</h3>
        <p>Playing sports year-round and into college shaped me into both a team player and a leader. If you're around me long enough, you'll probably end up running with me, pushing past your limits, or trying something that challenges you.</p>
        <div class="card-highlight">My competitive nature and background drive me to constantly strive for more in everything I do.</div>
