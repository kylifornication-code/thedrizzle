    ### 🗓️ Short Forecast

    A heavy down pour of life, learning, experimenting, and looking ahead. The last couple week's I've spent reflecting, finding gratitude, and trying to project **what are the bets I'm going to be making** in the next year.  

    **This week's project:** [Using Kiro AI to build a POC of a learning request platform for my team](#)

## 💦 Previous 14-day Forecast

- **20-25k days left to live:** First off, this isn't an existential post that I want to remember or others to remember as heavy. I have a privileged life, but I did just have a birthday and that's why I found [this post by Yew Jim about having 10k days left](https://yewjin.substack.com/p/note-to-my-present-self?r=ewzt3&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) so interesting. He says, "Time is only _real_ currency", and I couldn't agree more. I'm in my mid 30s and to realize that at best I have 25k days left (to reach 100 yrs old), or 20k to reach 90 yrs old, isn't a crisis, but it's a fact in the game of life. Sahil Bloom talks about something similar that I reflect on as well (tagged below)
