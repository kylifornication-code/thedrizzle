## Turning discomfort into discipline 

I’ve long believed that if I do something difficult each day, I won’t sweat the small stuff. Over the years, this mindset has helped me stay composed during stressful times—whether it's company layoffs, reorganizations, or setbacks from injuries (I've got some stories if you’re buying the drinks).

This post is about my _misogi_ for 2025. 

About five years ago, I started following Jesse Itzler after reading his book Living with a SEAL. Jesse, an entrepreneur and athlete, is the kind of guy crazy enough to invite the one and only David Goggins to live with him for 30 days—and keep up with whatever brutal training he dished out.

A few years back, Jesse introduced the fitness community to the concept of misogi. While traditional misogi involves purification rituals like cold-water immersion, Jesse redefined it as a challenge—pushing yourself to do something so difficult that the other 364 days of the year feel easier. That idea resonated with me immediately.

### Misogi: The Origin
> Misogi is an ancient Japanese practice rooted in Shinto traditions. It is used as a form of ritual purification. Historically, it involved cleansing the body and mind by immersing oneself in natural elements such as cold water or enduring other physically demanding activities. In modern interpretations, misogi has evolved into a broader philosophy that emphasizes pushing personal boundaries to cultivate resilience, self-awareness, and growth. This latter approach is what piqued my interest in the practice.

## My Misogi 2025

It felt fitting to kick off my blog with my misogi challenge for 2025. I actually brought this up with my team during our end-of-year meeting, because I’ve learned that sharing my goals turns them into commitments. And when others _expect_ me to follow through, I only get more determined.

### My Commmitments

In my pursuit of doing hard things, my misogi is simple—just a few key challenges. (Working in product management has taught me that trying to prioritize too many things at once usually leads to being stretched too thin or overcommitted)

- Run my third 4x4x48 race and my first marathon
- Apply and get into a masters program
- Balance having a new born and teenager with the first 2

#### Join me do something hard!

I'll be posting my racing event schedule on here soon, if you see a race you want to do together or meet up at, let me know!
