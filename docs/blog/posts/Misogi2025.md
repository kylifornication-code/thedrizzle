## Turning discomfort into discipline 

I've long operated on the idea that if I do something difficult each day then I won't sweat the small stuff. I've done this long enough in personal and professional life that I've been able to show poise during the stressful times of company layoffs/reorgs and even the hard phases of injuries that turn into setbacks - I've got some stories if you pay for drinks.

This post is about my misogi for 2025. About 5 years ago I started following Jesse Itzler after I read his book, "Living with a Seal". Only Jesse is crazy enough to have the one and only "Goggins" live with him and go where he went for 30d straight. Jesse is an entpreneur and athlete and a few years ago started to talk about a misogi challenge. While the original placement of misogi focused on certain practices like cold water immersion, the modern practice that Jesse brought to the fitness community was one channeling people to do something hard that would awaken then. Something *so hard* that the other 364 days would feel earned and deserved. This is where I was bought in - do something hard enough to make the other days feel easy. 

### Misogi: The Origin
> Misogi is an ancient Japanese practice rooted in Shinto traditions. It is used as a form of ritual purification. Historically, it involved cleansing the body and mind by immersing oneself in natural elements such as cold water or enduring other physically demanding activities. In modern interpretations, misogi has evolved into a broader philosophy that emphasizes pushing personal boundaries to cultivate resilience, self-awareness, and growth. This latter approach is what piqued my interest in the practice.

## My Misogi 2025

It seemed fitting that the first post for my blog would be about my misogi challenge for 2025. I brought this up with my team at work during our end of year/new year meeting. Personally, I've learned that sharing my goals can make them committments, and it only makes me more committed if others _expect that I deliver._ 

### My Commmitments

In my chase to do hard things, my misogi is simple and just a few things. (I've learned working as a product manager that if you think you can priortiize and optimize for more than a few things, you're often going to be stretched thin or oversubscribed)

- Run my third 4x4x48 race and my first marathon
- Apply and get into a masters program
- Balance having a new born and teenager with the first 2

#### Join me do something hard!

I'll be posting my racing event schedule on here soon, if you see a race you want to do together or meet up at, let me know!
