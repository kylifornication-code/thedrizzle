    ### Forecast: 

    A light drizzle of spec-driven development (SDD) with spec-kit, [GitHub's Specify project](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), and how my most recent project has me seeing SDD, and PRDs as a product leader and manager.

    ### What is the Drizzle? 

    When your're in the PNW, you'll hear about a couple things often, the mountain being out and constant drizzle of rain we get hit with. This blog is a light dump every couple of weeks of some thoughts, articles, and projects I'm working on - a light drizzle of content that's on my mind.
