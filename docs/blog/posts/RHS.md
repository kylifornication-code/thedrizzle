!!! Preface
    
    When I woke up Dec 12th, I knew something was off but I didn't realize what and how serious it was. I didn't realize the next 1.5 years to now (June 2025) would be full of lessons -  now gratitude - but naturally life is going to life. 

    I told myself I'd write about my journey with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome eventually though. Not so much to reflect, but to share my timeline objectively and hopefully it could help someone else. 

## Purpose of this Post

* Share my timeline - when I got diagnosed, rediagnosed, found help, started feeling better, and where I'm at now
* Share what made my recovery have a good outcome

## Timeline

Let's start with a timeline; this will start off mostly day by day and will skip to weeks and months to now.
