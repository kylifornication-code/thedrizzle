## Don't you mean reading list?

I stopped reading books a long time ago. For as long as I can remember, I’ve never enjoyed reading and always struggled to visualize what others would call a _great read_. Instead, I consume all my "reading" content by listening. I've used screen readers, podcasts, and even AI (you should try NotebookLM or ChatGPT's transcriber) to help me get content into medium that work well for me. 

My trick? I always have a book or podcast playing while I'm on the road or basically any chance I'm alone. I find the best time to listen to books and podcasts during my long runs. HOver the years, I’ve turned to Audible and various podcasts to get my fix — that’s what I’ll be sharing in this post.

**Spoiler**: There won’t be any fiction. I’m all about business and books rooted in real life stories.
