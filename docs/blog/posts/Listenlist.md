## Don't you mean reading list?

I stopped reading books a long time ago because it just never clicked for me. I’ve always struggled to visualize what others call a “great read,” so instead, I consume my “reading” by listening—whether that’s through screen readers, podcasts, or even AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT’s transcriber. These options give me the freedom to absorb information in a medium that truly works for me.

My strategy? I almost always have a book or podcast playing whenever I’m driving or any time I’m on my own. It’s especially effective during long runs—there’s nothing like lacing up for a run and immersing myself in a captivating story or fascinating conversation. Over the years, Audible and an ever-growing list of podcasts have become my go-to sources for continuous learning and entertainment. In this post, I’ll share the shows and audiobooks that have kept me hooked.
