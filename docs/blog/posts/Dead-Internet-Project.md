!!! Preface
    ### What I built and why I built it: 

    A modularized MCP powered Chrome plugin that allows one to rght click on text in their browser and choose a couple different options to analyze the text. 

    I built this tool because I'm starting some graduate studies in the fall and I've heard the submissions are reviewed for AI. I often use AI but don't rely on it and want to assure what I'm writing doesn't get flagged. I've also been interested in using FAST API to build an MCP server, especially with docker. And I believe the best way to learn is to *do*.

    ### Why it matters: 

    Many AI validation tools like Grammarly and others require you to copy and paste text into their sites/portals to evaluate it. Personally, the UX flow just isn't great, unless you're having it review large papers. Apple recently came out with "Writing Tools" built into Apple Intelligence in the context menu and it covers typical AI use cases like proofreading, summarization, rewriting, and making the writing sound different (friendly, professional, concise). It doesn't cover use cases for analyzing text for AI drafting like what I was looking for. I often look for tooling that is easy to use, easy to build upon, and easy to customize.

## Getting Started: Building an MCP Server

I knew when I got started on this project that I wanted to build something fast. I love rapid prototyping and with AI it's really ignited my passion for learning and building out my ideas quickly to a proof of concept (PoC). Here's a few prompts I used to get started on this that helped me make decisions on which direction to go in. 

!!! Prompt Question
    I'm looking to build a project that helps me evaluate my writing for AI and the likelihood of it being AI generated. Below are some goals, technology I'd like to work with, and constraints. Provide me 3 different options that could help me decide what I can pursue, include pros and cons.
    
    Technology:
    - MCP framework
    - FAST API
    - Python
    - Docker
    - OpenAI Pro Account
    
    Constraints: 
    - Must be selectable in the context menu while in a browser
    - Must be modular so I can add features to it without much overhead
    - Must be able to run locally
    
    Goals: 
    - As a user, I want to be able to use the context menu on any site that allows me to evaluate the likelihood of the text I'm highlighting being generated by AI. 
    - As a developer of the tool, I want a repeatable and modular framework for adding features to this based on highlighted text. 

The suggestions it gave ranged from a local docker listener that read all text on my screen, even outside my browser, and a javascript based bookmarklet that sees all text in your browser, to a chrome plugin that can be installed and triggered just in time. For me, I liked the bookmarklet and chrome plugin techniques. I've built simple bookmarklets before to scrape pages for SEO analysis so I could review competitor site keywords quickly but because I wanted to build something on FAST API (no support for js) I knew that going the chrome route could be fun, especially as something new to learn. 

## Key aspects of building a Chrome Plugin

This was my first Chrome plugin project so I needed to do some research into how to approach it. From a general point of view, this is something AI does well but when you get into the deep part of supported classes and targeting specific versions of packages and APIs this is something I've seen AI not do well; and I've spent hours troubleshooting hallucinations and reverting because of how much code needs to be evaluated. I usually approach learning new coding projects trying to understand it as a system - what is the file layout
