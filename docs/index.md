# Welcome to my site!
![Personal](img/office.png)

I'm KJ, a passionate technologist that loves building stuff. 

One of my goals for this site is to share my operating system — how I think and work. I hope to write about my professional endouvers, like entrepeneurship, business, engineering and projects I'm working on.

*A little bit about me...*

I've worked in Product, Engineering, and Security. I'm at my happiest when I'm building things. You'll find me constantly 3d printing and writing into my phone scribbling down my thoughts. I'm a dad, husband, brother, and my family is important to me. 

This site serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing my current projects and providing a platform for my thoughts and ideas through my [blog](blog/index.md).

Feel free to explore my [GitLab projects](projects.md) and check out my blog for the latest updates and articles!
