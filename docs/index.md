# Welcome!

I'm KJ, a passionate technologist that loves building stuff. 

One of my goals for this site is to share my operating system — how I think and work. I hope to write about my professional endouvers, like entrepeneurship, business, engineering and projects I'm working on.

A little bit about me...

I've worked in Product, Engineering, and Security. I'm at my happiest when I'm building things. You'll find me constantly 3d printing and writing into my phone scribbling down my thoughts. I'm a dad, husband, brother, and my family is important to me. 

This site serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing my current projects and providing a platform for my thoughts and ideas through my blog.

Feel free to explore my GitLab projects and check out my blog for the latest updates and articles!
